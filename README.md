A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for **Polarion ALM**, built for real-world instances: every write supports `dry_run`, guards validate fields and enum values before anything is committed, and requests are paced to a rate cap you configure for your instance — so an AI assistant can work on production data without surprises.

![mcp-server-polarion demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devemberx/mcp-server-polarion/main/.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Features

- **47 tools** covering read and write across documents, work items, test runs, traceability links, comments, and attachments.
- **Read** — render documents as Markdown, search with Lucene or SQL, walk incoming/outgoing links, resolve enum options.
- **Write** — create and update work items, documents, and test runs, manage links, reorganize document structure, post comments.
- **Safe writes** — every write tool supports `dry_run`, and pre-write guards validate fields, enum values, and link targets before hitting Polarion.
- **Plays nice with your server** — requests are serialized and paced to a configurable rate cap, with automatic retries on 429/5xx responses.
- **Built for LLMs** — strict async, fully typed, pagination on every list tool, docstrings written as the assistant's manual.

## Quickstart

Requires **Polarion 2506+** and [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). Fastest path — Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add mcp-server-polarion \
  -e POLARION_URL=https://polarion.example.com \
  -e POLARION_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token \
  -- uvx mcp-server-polarion
```

Other clients (VS Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor) — see [Client Configuration](#client-configuration).

## Setup

### Prerequisites

> **Polarion 2506 or higher** is required. Earlier versions lack REST API endpoints this server depends on.

This server is distributed as a Python package and requires [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to run.

**Install uv** (if not already installed):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Or via pip:

```bash
pip install uv
```

No other installation is needed — `uvx mcp-server-polarion` downloads and runs the server automatically.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `POLARION_URL` | Base URL of your Polarion instance | `https://polarion.example.com` |
| `POLARION_TOKEN` | Personal Access Token for authentication | `your-personal-access-token` |
| `POLARION_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND` | Optional. Client-side request rate cap — raise it to match your deployment's throttle, or set `0` to disable pacing. Writes keep a fixed extra pause regardless (default: `1`) | `1` |

To generate a Personal Access Token, open Polarion, click your user name, and go to **My Account → Personal Access Tokens**.
