# Work items and links

Work item query, delete, document-membership, and link contracts. Read before touching `list_work_items`, `get_work_item`, `read_work_item`, `create_work_items`, `update_work_items`, `move_work_item_to_document`, `move_work_item_from_document`, or any `*_work_item_links` tool. Baseline Polarion REST API v2506.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `projects/{p}/workitems` | `query=linkedWorkItems:{wi}` is the only back-link direction |
| GET | `projects/{p}/workitems/{wi}/teststeps` | Paginated Test Steps rows; request `index,keys,values` |
| DELETE | `projects/{p}/workitems` | 204 with a `{"data": [...]}` body |
| DELETE | `projects/{p}/workitems/{wi}` | 405 — the single-resource form does not exist |
| GET | `projects/{p}/workitems/{wi}/backlinkedworkitems` | unsupported |
| POST | `projects/{p}/workitems/{wi}/actions/moveToDocument` | flat body, not `{"data": [...]}` |
| POST | `projects/{p}/workitems/{wi}/actions/moveFromDocument` | takes no body |
| GET, POST, DELETE | `projects/{p}/workitems/{wi}/linkedworkitems` | DELETE takes a `{"data": [...]}` body |
| PATCH | `projects/{p}/workitems/{wi}/linkedworkitems/{role}/{targetProject}/{targetId}` | the link coordinate — the same 5 segments as the link `id` |

## Read contract

- Back-links come from `query=linkedWorkItems:{wi}`, and those results carry `role=None` — the role is not recoverable in that direction.
- Test Steps rows pair `attributes.keys` and `attributes.values` by position. Each rich-text value is `text/html`; preserve configured keys and treat unequal arrays as malformed.

## Write contract

- The collection-body DELETE returns 204. This is API capability only: the repo ships no work item delete tool by policy, and documents stay 405 either way.

## Server does not validate

- `workitemimg:` refs in a description — accepted verbatim (204) and persisted. Guard: `guard/work_items.py` `guard_work_item_attachment_refs`, built on `guard/_attachment_refs.py`.
- Link targets and roles — accepted unvalidated. Guard: `guard/links.py` against the project's `workitem-link-role` enum, `guard/_targets.py` for target existence.

## Cross-domain

- Work item attachment ids, which make `workitemimg:` tokens unpredictable before upload: [attachments.md](attachments.md).
- Ghost refs in comment bodies: [comments.md](comments.md).
